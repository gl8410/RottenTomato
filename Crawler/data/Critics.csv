the_white_king|Rob Aldam|Backseat Mafia|F|The White King is an impressive adaptation which is believable whilst wearing a cloak of mystery.|NA|June 17, 2019|N
the_white_king|Matthew Anderson|CineVue|R|The only elements of The White King that prevent it from being an unmitigated failure are a striking visual aesthetic and solid production values. However, these do not prevent Alex Helfrecht and Jorg Tittel's venture being one to miss.|2/5|December 28, 2017|N
the_white_king|Shelagh Rowan-Legg|ScreenAnarchy|F|The White King is an impressive feature debut...|NA|December 14, 2017|N
the_white_king|Paul Risker|PopMatters|F|The White King is a bold and brave piece of filmmaking that embraces film as an incomplete form. The ideas are presented in such a way that they require the engagement of the audience.|8/10|March 30, 2017|N
the_white_king|Fred McNamara|Starburst|F|The story exudes natural confidence in its execution of that tension. It knows exactly when to pull you in and push you back.|8/10|February 2, 2017|N
the_white_king|David Parkinson|Empire Magazine|F|The makers have clearly thought about what a future reversion to twentieth century-style tyranny would look like, and the design, anthems and details all ring true.|3/5|January 30, 2017|N
the_white_king|Wendy Ide|Observer (UK)|F|"It's an impressively realised world; the ""Homeland"" is an agrarian totalitarian state in which any form of dissent is quashed by jackboot justice."|3/5|January 29, 2017|N
the_white_king|Kate Muir|Times (UK)|R|The White King never quite fulfils its initial promise as a dystopian young-adult adventure set in a future police state.|2/5|January 27, 2017|Y
the_white_king|Rich Cline|Shadows on the Wall|F|This chilling undertone keeps the audience gripped even when the story seems to spin its wheels.|3/5|January 27, 2017|N
the_white_king|Dan Einav|Little White Lies|R|The White King is a respectable first feature, but one that would have benefitted from refinement and nuance - a good few moves behind the best films in the genre.|2/5|January 27, 2017|Y
the_white_king|Stephen Carty|Radio Times|R|The White King only springs to life when Pryce is on screen, which isn't often.|2/5|January 26, 2017|N
the_white_king|Peter Bradshaw|Guardian|F|An intriguing, sombre work.|3/5|January 26, 2017|Y
the_white_king|MaryAnn Johanson|Flick Filosopher|R|This sad mess of a vaguely sci-fi coming-of-age tale seemingly could not be more plugged into current fears, and yet it feels utterly irrelevant.|1.5/5|January 26, 2017|N
the_white_king|Philip Kemp|Total Film|F|Co-directors Alex Helfrecht and JÃ¶rg Tittel devise a convincingly scary dystopia crossing Nazi Germany with Stalin's Russia. Too bad Helfrecht's script lets it down.|3/5|January 23, 2017|N
the_white_king|Stefan Pape|HeyUGuys|F|What allows for the viewer to immerse themselves in this universe with such ease, is by having a child as our entry point, as we adopt their blissful perspective, observing and absorbing just as he is.|3/5|January 23, 2017|N
the_white_king|Poppy-Jay Palmer|SciFiNow|F|The cast of politically diverse and divisive characters offer a very human look at both sides of the mechanics of a dictatorship, from the people constantly being affected by it to the people making it happen.|4/5|January 20, 2017|N
the_white_king|David Kettle|The Arts Desk|F|Fascinating and unsettling.|NA|September 9, 2016|N
the_white_king|Neil Young|Hollywood Reporter|F|Intriguing but ultimately underwhelming.|NA|September 9, 2016|Y
the_white_king|Charles Gant|Screen International|F|Essentially refracting Orwell's 1984 through the eyes of a 12-year-old boy, the film succeeds best at evoking its sinister, hermetic world.|NA|June 27, 2016|N
the_white_king|Rachel Bowles|The Skinny|R|Why does The White King, though undeniably topical, dramatic and moving enough during its running time, not feel at all urgent or pressing?|3/5|June 22, 2016|N
the_white_king|Emma Simmonds|The List|F|The White King isn't especially thought-provoking, nor sophisticated enough to win over accompanying adults. Regardless, the combination of brutality-lite, high jinks and life lessons may be enough to satisfy older kids.|3/5|June 21, 2016|N
